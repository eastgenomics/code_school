# Task for 14/11/23:

***Plot a precision recall plot using output from happy for 6 samples in b37 and b38.***
- You can choose whether you want SNPs and Indels in the same plot or not.
- I would like the plots to be fully annotated with axis labels and titles
- Different colours for the b37 and b38 scatter within the same plot.
- Threshold lines for fails (optional warnings) as seen in the table below.
- Consider whether you want to set your own axis limits
