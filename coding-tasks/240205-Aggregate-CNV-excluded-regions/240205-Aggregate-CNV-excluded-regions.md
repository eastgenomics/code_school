## Task for 28/11/23:

Aggregate all CNV excluded regions and create a table with all regions that have been ever excluded with a count of how many times for each interval and annotated with hgnc ids and gene symbols.

* Start from run 002_230718_A01295_0200_AH3KTGDRX3_CEN onwards
* You may need to unarchive some of them
* Files end in *_excluded_intervals.bed and exist in the GATK CNV output folder (for example: /output/CEN-230719_1604/eggd_GATKgCNV_call_v1.0.1-CEN_v2.0.2-230720-1/CNV_summary)
